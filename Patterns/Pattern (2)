// Code Explanation:
// The program uses nested loops to print a 4x4 pattern of characters.
// - The outer loop (variable `i`) runs 4 times (0 to 3).
// - The inner loop (variable `j`) also runs 4 times (0 to 3).
// - Inside the inner loop, a character variable `ch` is initialized to 'A' at the start of each row.
// - The inner loop prints the value of `ch` and increments it, so it prints 'A' to 'D' in each row.
// - After the inner loop completes, `cout << endl;` moves to the next line.
// - As `ch` is reinitialized to 'A' in every iteration of the outer loop, the same sequence is printed in all rows.

    int i, j;
    for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
        char ch = 'A'; // Reset ch to 'A' at the start of each row
        for (j = 0; j < 4; j++) {
            cout << ch << " "; // Print character and a space
            ch++; // Move to next character
        }
        cout << endl; // Move to the next line after printing 4 characters
    }
